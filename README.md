# Machine_Learning_Classifiers_Project
Evauation of label-noise-robust classifiers, Forward Correction and Co-teaching, across FashionMNIST and CIFAR. Comparison of accuracy under symmetric/asymmetric noise and assesses transition-matrix estimation. Results show Co-teaching excels on complex or asymmetric noise, while Forward Correction performs best on symmetric noise.
